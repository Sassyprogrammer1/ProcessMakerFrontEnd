# Problem Statement

In todays world there is a high demand of software engineers and other IT professionals,
and millions of companies world wide are often looking for quiality candidates as their employees
which becomes really difficult to get. Following are the reasons that we think are the main cause 
of the hinderance in the recruitment process in todays needs. 

1. Companies are bound to use predefined recuitment assessments. A company cant make their own process
of hiring or their own workflow of assessments. For e.g if you use hackerrank you will only be assessed for your technical skills, but the company also wants to test the candidates communications skills. Now the company will try to use some other tool.

2. It's pretty difficult to manage a lot of applications to assess candidates. Recruiters are looking for one platform to manage all their assessment workflows and have data visualizations to easily filter out.

3. We don't have applications which can integrate with alot of social networks or management tools. For e.g if I want to make an assessment and I also want that all the candidates and the company should be well engaged with the process on different channels, recruiters will again have to manage a lot of tools, so they are looking for a single dashboard to manage all their notifications and messages on different channels automatically.

# Solution 

We have thought of an idea which solves all of these problems in the following way.

1. Our application will provide recruiters and companies to orchestrate assessment workflows. For e.g if a recruiter or a company wants to orchestrate their own hiring workflow they can easily add multiple assessments from a wide range of options like, communications assessment followed by a cognitive assessment followed by a behaviour assessment followed by a technical assessment. They can do all this by using their favourite assessment tools like hackerrank, codility. They can also create their own custom assessment forms to assess candidates based on companies requirements.

2. Our application will provide a single dashboard to access all the apps and workflows and all the integrations. For e.g a recruiter can add slack integrations and other communication channels integrations to automatically notify the candidates and companies. Similarly the candidates score from different workflows will be shown as data visualizations on the dashboard so a company can easily filter out their desired candidates.

3. Our application will help the recruiters to manage everything from a single source.
